## Getting the data

1. Go to the supplemental materials of Hug et al. 2016: [link](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol201648#supplementary-information)
2. Download **Supplementary Dataset 2** (the tree in a text format called `Newick` format)

## Loading the tree

1. Go to the interactive tree of life: [iTOL](http://itol.embl.de/)
2. Click on **Upload**
3. Give the tree a name (e.g. `Tree of Life`) and upload the **Supplementary Dataset 2** that you downloaded

## Customizing the visualization

1. In `Controls -> Basic`, switch **Display Mode** to `Unrooted`
2. In `Controsl -> Basic`, switch **Parameters** to `270` degrees rotation
3. In `Controls -> Advanced`, switch **Leaf Sorting** to `None`
4. Start to look familiar?

## Pruning the tree

This tree has way more information than we want at the moment. Time to prune it.
