## Terminology

 - **Oxidation state**: a number that represents the number of electrons that an atom has gained or lost
 - **Reduction**: gain electrons (↓ oxidation state)
 - **Oxidation**: lose electrons (↑ oxidation state)


|                       General Equation                        |                        Example                         |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------:|
| $\ce{A_{red} <=>T[oxidation][reduction] A_{ox}}$ | $\ce{CH4 <=>T[oxidation][reduction] CO2}$ |

 - **Oxidant**: chemical species that oxidizes something else, and gets reduced
 - **Reductant**: chemical species that reduces something else, and gets oxidized
 - **Redox potential**: the thermodynamic preference of a species to be an oxidant or a reductant, measured in volts (typically V or mV)

## Rules for assigning oxidation state

1. Any atoms in elemental form have an oxidation state of 0 ex: $\ce{O2}$, $\ce{N2}$, $\ce{S0}$, $\ce{Fe(s)}$
2. The more electronegative elements in a compound will have a negative oxidation state, while the less electronegative elements in a compound will have a positive oxidation state. As a result of their electronegativities, some elements will almost always have certain oxidation states.
   - Alkali metals are always +1
   - Alkaline earth metals are always +2
   - Fluorine is always -1
   - Hydrogen is almost always +1 (**Exception**: metal hydrides, ex: $\ce{NaH}$, where H is -1 because Na is +1 and the compound is neutral.)
   - Oxygen is almost always -2 (**Exceptions**: peroxides, ex $\ce{H2O2}$, where O is -1 because H can only donate 1 electron and the compound is neutral; and $\ce{F2O}$, where O is +2 because F is the only thing more electronegative than O.
3. The sum of oxidation states in a species is equal to the net charge of the species.

These rules allow you to work out the oxidation states for other elements with more versatile oxidation states.

Carbon has 4 valance electrons, so it can lose up to 4 electrons or gain up to 4 electrons for a full outer shell. Therefore, carbon has an 8 electron range in oxidation states, from -4 to +4.

| Oxidation state |     -4     |     -3      |     -2      |     -1      |      0      |      +1       |     +2      |     +3      |     +4     |
|-----------------|:----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:----------:|
| Example         | $\ce{CH4}$ | $\ce{C2H6}$ | $\ce{C2H4}$ | $\ce{C2H2}$ | $\ce{CH2O}$ | $\ce{C2H2O2}$ | $\ce{CHO2}$ | $\ce{C2O4}$ | $\ce{CO2}$ |

## Half reactions

A redox reaction $\ce{A_{red} + B_{ox} -> B_{red} + A_{ox}}$ can also be written as two **half reactions**.

$$
\ce{A_{red} -> A_{ox} + e-} \\
\ce{B_{ox} + e- -> B_{red}}
$$

Half reactions are a theoretical concept as there are not really any free electrons as a chemical compound in a chemical system, but it is a very useful one for thinking about redox:

## Rules for balancing redox reactions

This is one possible approach for systematically balancing redox reactions.

1. Write out the two half reactions
2. Balance all elements except H & O
3. Balance O with H2O
4. Balance H with H+
5. Balance charge with e- [check yourself here that the number of electrons transferred matches the change in oxidation state]
6. Multiply half reactions so that the number of electrons match
7. Add half reactions together
