Energy flows directionally through ecosystems, entering as solar energy for **phototrophs** or as chemical energy for **chemotrophs** and following the thermodynamic gradient towards chemical equilibrium. The elements that constitute the building blocks of life, however, can take on many different chemical forms and cycle between the reservoirs of the **atmosphere**, **hydrosphere** (water), **biosphere** (life) and **lithosphere** (rock) on a wide range of time scales. Geologic processes, such as erosion, water drainage, the movement of the continental plates, and weathering, all are involved in the cycling of these elements. Depending on abundance and chemical form within a reservoir, some of these elements are accessible (**bioavailable**) to all organisms, some only to a subset, some not at all. Various biological processes affect the chemical forms of these elements through both **assimilatory** processes (the conversion and use of a molecule/element as a cellular building block) and **dissimilatory** processes (the chemical conversion of a molecule/element for energetic gains). Because biology, geology and chemistry all play major roles, the (re)cycling of inorganic matter between living organisms and their nonliving environment is called a biogeochemical cycle.

## Which Elements?

All elements that can undergo energy-yielding redox reactions in places where life is present (e.g. pretty much everywhere on Earth's surface) under the available conditions (temperate, pressure, concentrations, etc.) can be and usually are involved in **dissimilatory** processes.

The six most common building blocks of life are carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur (CHNOPS). Additionally, several trace elements play an important role for specific enzymes and processes including iron, manganese, zinc, copper, nickel and selenium. All elements that are not readily available in the correct concentrations or chemical form have to be acquired through active transport into the cell, chemical conversion and other **assimilatory** processes.

For a quick refresher on the role that CHNOPS play in cells, watch the following 10 minute video by YouTube educator Paul Anderson:

## Microbes

Microorganisms play important roles at almost every steps of the major biogeochemical cycles on Earth, most frequently by interconverting the oxidized and reduced forms of the cycled elements. Some of the key microbes and microbial processes are highlighted in the cycles discussed below.

## Cycles

In this module we will discuss several of the most important biogeochemical cycles starting with the carbon, nitrogen and sulfur cycle. The following summaries adapted from Lumen Learning provide some foundational knowledge to get everyone on the same page.

### Carbon Cycle

Carbon is one of the most important elements to living organisms, as shown by its abundance and presence in all organic molecules. The **carbon cycle** exemplifies the connection between organisms in various ecosystems. Carbon is exchanged between **heterotrophs** and **autotrophs** within and between ecosystems primarily by way of atmospheric CO2, a fully oxidized version of carbon that serves as the basic building block that autotrophs use to build multicarbon, high-energy organic molecules such as glucose. Photoautotrophs and chemoautotrophs harness energy from the sun and from inorganic chemical compounds, respectively, to covalently bond carbon atoms together into reduced organic compounds whose energy can be later accessed through the processes of **respiration** and **fermentation**. Overall, there is a constant exchange of CO2 between the heterotrophs (which produce CO2 as a result of respiration or fermentation) and the autotrophs (which use the CO2 for fixation).

Bacteria and archaea that use methane as their carbon source are called **methanotrophs**. Reduced one-carbon compounds like methane accumulate in certain anaerobic environments when CO2 is used as a terminal electron acceptor in anaerobic respiration by archaea called **methanogens**. Some methanogens also ferment acetate (two carbons) to produce methane and CO2. Methane accumulation due to **methanogenesis** occurs in both natural anaerobic soil and aquatic environments; methane accumulation also occurs as a result of animal husbandry because methanogens are members of the normal microbiota of ruminants. Environmental methane accumulation due to methanogenesis is of consequence because it is a strong greenhouse gas, and methanotrophs help to reduce atmospheric methane levels.

### Nitrogen Cycle

Many biological macromolecules, including proteins and nucleic acids, contain nitrogen; however, getting nitrogen into living organisms is difficult. Prokaryotes play essential roles in the **nitrogen cycle**, transforming nitrogen between various forms for their own needs, benefiting other organisms indirectly. Plants and **phytoplankton** cannot incorporate nitrogen from air (where it exists as tightly bonded, triple covalent N2), even though this molecule composes approximately 78% of the atmosphere. Nitrogen enters the living world through free-living and symbiotic bacteria, which incorporate nitrogen into their macromolecules through specialized biochemical pathways called **nitrogen fixation**. Nitrogen fixing microorganisms are called **diazotrophs** and are distributed throughout the archaeal and bacterial domains of life. *Cyanobacteria* in aquatic ecosystems, *Azotobacteriales* in soils and symbiotic *Rhizobiales* in the root nodules of legumes are some of the major bacterial diazotrophs.

The nitrogen that enters living systems by nitrogen fixation is eventually converted from organic nitrogen back into nitrogen gas by microbes through three steps: **ammonification**, **nitrification**, and **denitrification**. In terrestrial systems, the first step is the ammonification process, in which certain bacteria and fungi convert nitrogenous waste from living animals or from the remains of dead organisms into ammonium ($\ce{NH4^+}$). This ammonium is then oxidized to nitrite ($\ce{NO2^-}$), then to nitrate ($\ce{NO3^-}$) by nitrifying soil bacteria such as members of the genus *Nitrosomonas*, through the process of nitrification. Last, the process of denitrification occurs, whereby soil bacteria, such as members of the genera *Pseudomonas*, *Paracoccus* and *Clostridium*, use nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor in anaerobic respiration, converting it into nitrogen gas that reenters the atmosphere. A similar process occurs in the marine nitrogen cycle, where these three processes are performed by marine bacteria and archaea.

To get a better sense for how the different nitrogen reservoirs are connected, play the following animation (use the original link below if the embedded version does not work).

### Sulfur Cycle

Sulfur is an essential element for the macromolecules of living organisms and involved in many redox processes. Several groups of microbes are responsible for carrying out processes involved in the sulfur cycle. Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria as well as chemoautotrophic archaea and bacteria use hydrogen sulfide as an electron donor, oxidizing it first to elemental sulfur ($\ce{S0}$), then to sulfate ($\ce{SO4^{2âˆ’}}$). This leads to stratification of hydrogen sulfide in soil and sediments, with levels increasing at deeper, more anaerobic depths. Many bacteria and plants can use sulfate as a sulfur source. Decomposition dead organisms by fungi and bacteria remove sulfur groups from amino acids, producing hydrogen sulfide, returning inorganic sulfur to the environment.
